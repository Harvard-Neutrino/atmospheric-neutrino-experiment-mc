# Monte Carlo Simulations
We provide the MC simlation files of atmospheric neutrinos for the following experiments in [HDF5]() format:
 - SuperK: No neutron tagging covering the first 3 phases of the experiment.
 - SuperK with neutron tagging on Hydrogen: For phases 4 and 5 of SuperK and also used as HyperK's simulation file.
 - SuperK with neutron tagging on Gd: Assumes the SuperK detector is loaded with Gd at the goal concentration of 0.1/%.
 - IceCube-Upgrade: Copied from publibly available simulation from the [IceCube Collaboration]() converted into .hdf5 format for completeness.
 - ORCA: Projected simulation based on IceCube-Upgrade's upgrade Monte Carlo applying reported detector response.
